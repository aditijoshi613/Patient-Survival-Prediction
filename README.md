# Patient Survival Prediction

## DATA604 Final Project

### Data Description
The Patient Survival Prediction dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mitishaagarwal/patient) consists of various factors related to hospitalized patients. There are 91713 data points with 85 features each. The dataset has a binary output variable “hospital_death” representing whether the patient died (1) or not (0). This study considers the binary classification problem to determine whether death will occur in the case of a patient, given the factors related to their hospitalization.
